THREE-TIER-ARCHITECTURE-USING-TERRAFORM

In this project, I utilized Terraform üèóÔ∏è to build a robust three-tier architecture in Amazon Web Services (AWS) ‚òÅÔ∏è. Through this project, I showcased my expertise in deploying complex infrastructure setups in real-world scenarios, demonstrating my proficiency with Terraform.

Key provisions made in this project include:

1Ô∏è‚É£ VPC with 2 public and 4 private subnets
2Ô∏è‚É£ Internet Gateway and a NAT Gateway
3Ô∏è‚É£ Two Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) with load balancers
4Ô∏è‚É£ Security groups and route tables

By integrating these components, I successfully created a monolithic architecture, ensuring scalability and optimal performance. üöÄ
